# CS550-FallTerm
Some of my files from fall term 

File: numbers1-10: this file is just a basic usage of different random inputs. It was a beggining homework and also has some if statements that have different results. [link to page](https://github.com/wwildridge19/CS550-FallTerm/blob/master/number1-10.py)
