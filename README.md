# CS550-FallTerm
Some of my files from fall term 

File: numbers1-10: this file is just a basic usage of different random inputs. It was a beggining homework and also has some if statements that have different results. [link to page](https://github.com/wwildridge19/CS550-FallTerm/blob/master/number1-10.py)

File: game copy.py : this was my first major project. It has a lot of if statements some booleans, functions, and other basics. Pretty good I think. It is a roll play text based game. [link to page](https://github.com/wwildridge19/CS550-FallTerm/blob/master/game%20copy.py)

File: Fib copy.py: Some basics with the fibbinachi sequence and recursive code. [link to page](https://github.com/wwildridge19/CS550-FallTerm/blob/master/fib%20copy.py)
